## About me

- Investigator (Biostatistics) @ [TIMI Study Group](https://timi.org/) / [Brigham and Womens Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/)  
- Lecturer @ [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) / [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu)


## Research 

My research focuses on the application of statistical and machine learning approaches for the assessment of complex predictors and interactions in precision cardiovascular medicine and exposome-wide analysis. More details and several slides of recent talks and presentations are available [here](https://andreabellavia.github.io/presentations/)

## Software

- [R, SAS, and Stata functions](https://github.com/andreabellavia/RCSplines) to incorporate non-linear and non-additive effects in regression models with restricted cubic splines
- [interactionRCS:](https://github.com/gmelloni/interactionRCS) R functions to smoothly plot the effect of a  predictor of interest over levels of a second continuous covariate after specifying flexible interactions in regression models
- [med4way:](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30452641/) a Stata command for estimating the 4-way decomposition of the total effect in mediation analysis
